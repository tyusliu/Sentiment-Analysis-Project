# Sentiment-Analysis-Project

In this project I was curious to learn about implementing different machine learning models for sentiment analysis. In [the python notebook](sentiment_analysis.ipynb) you'll find code that uses Naive Bayes, LSTM, and BERT for sentiment analysis. We ultimately form a model with 83% accuracy on the test set.
